# Nepali-Food-Recognition
 This project uses Mask R-CNN to detect food items and calculate their calorie values. It features an ESP32-CAM for image capture, NodeJS for the server, and ReactJS for the user interface. Calorie data is fetched via a Nutrition API, with intake history and daily calorie targets displayed to promote healthy eating habits.
